# Developing Etiquette
- Stable branch will be used to store the most stable version of the application. This branch must have a functioning and running appliction all the times. 
- Main branch can be used to work together and for implementation and testing etc. Code must be able to run
- All the other branch will be used for development and testing. Etiquette to be decided.
